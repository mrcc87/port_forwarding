# forward.yml configuration
# management_ip = the management ip of the machine which will serve as bridge
# username = username for ssh connection
# password = password for the ssh user
# production_ips = list of production ips to which you want to connect.
#   - ip = specific production ip
#     remote_ports = list of remote ports to which you want to create the tunner
#     local_ports = list of local ports to which tie the specific tunnel
#
# NOTES:
#  1) the bridge machine has to be able to reach the sockets (ip:remote_port combination)
#  2) local_ports list has to be equal to remote_ports list. If you want the local port to be the same
#     as the remote port set it to 0. If you want the local port to be different set the specific port.
#
#
#
#
#
#
# EXAMPLES:
#  1) one ssh connection with one port forwarding on the same local port as the remote
#
#   - management_ip: 172.19.100.100
#     username: administrator
#     password: Password1
#     production_ips:
#       - ip: 172.26.100.100
#         remote_ports: [80]
#         local_ports: [0]
#
#  2) one ssh connection with two port forwardings on two local ports, one the same as the remote, the other different
#
#   - management_ip: 172.19.100.100
#     username: administrator
#     password: Password1
#     production_ips:
#       - ip: 172.26.100.100
#         remote_ports: [80, 8080]
#         local_ports: [0, 1234]
#
#  3) one ssh connection with two port forwardings on two productions ips, on the same local ports as the remotes
#
#   - management_ip: 172.19.100.100
#     username: administrator
#     password: Password1
#     production_ips:
#       - ip: 172.26.100.100
#         remote_ports: [80]
#         local_ports: [0]
#       - ip: 172.26.100.150
#         remote_ports: [1521]
#         local_ports: [0]
#
#  4) two ssh connections with two port forwardings each on one production ip, on the same local ports as the remotes
#
#   - management_ip: 192.168.1.3
#     username: administrator
#     password: Password1
#     production_ips:
#       - ip: 192.168.100.150
#         remote_ports: [80]
#         local_ports: [0]
#
#   - management_ip: 172.19.100.100
#     username: administrator
#     password: Password1
#     production_ips:
#       - ip: 172.26.100.150
#         remote_ports: [1521]
#         local_ports: [0]
#
