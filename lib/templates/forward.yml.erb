# forward.yml configuration
# management_ip = the management ip of the machine which will serve as bridge
# username = username for ssh connection
# password = password for the ssh user
# production_ips = list of production ips to which you want to connect.
#   - ip = specific production ip
#     remote_ports = list of remote ports to which you want to create the tunner
#     local_ports = list of local ports to which tie the specific tunnel
#
#  NOTES:
#  1) the bridge machine has to be able to reach the sockets (ip:remote_port combination)
#  2) local_ports list has to be equal to remote_ports list. If you want the local port to be the same
#     as the remote port set it to 0. If you want the local port to be different set the specific port.
